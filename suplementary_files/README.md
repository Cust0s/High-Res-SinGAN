Course Project Presentations
============================

Included with this repository are the three presentations that were held during the course.

- The [first](SinGAN_paper_presentation.pdf) presentation focusses on the original [SinGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)
paper and includes our preliminary reproduced results.

- The [second](project_proposal_presentation.pdf) presentation includes a comprehensive overview of our reporoduced results 
and includes the project proposal as well as preliminary experiments towards the proposed
goal.

- The [third](final_presentation.pdf) presentation is a conclusion of our work with High-Res-SinGAN. It includes an 
explanation of our methods for high resolution image generation, as well as sample images.

As the [project proposal presentation](project_proposal_presentation.pdf) PDF does not display any animations, the reproduced 
results of the original network from *slide 7* are included [here](./supplementary_animations).
